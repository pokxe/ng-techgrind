# Service: steam
#   wraps around the $http service to access the sTeam REST api.
#   ( http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$http )
#
#   uses http://angularjs.org/object/localStorageService
#   to store data in the browsers localstorage
#
#   provides functions to handle login, get data, put new objects and post updates
#
#   functions return a promise object which expects a callback function as argument:
#
#   steam.<function>(args).then(callback_handler)
#
#   callback_handler needs to be defined before calling the service.
#   it receives the data from the server as argument:
#
#   handle_request = (data) ->
#      # do something with the data
#
#   public functions are:
#      login(username, password): 
#          take and store login data
#      logout: remove login data
#      loginp: return true if the user is logged in, false otherwise
#      user: return userdetails if logged in
#      get(resource):
#          make a GET request and return resulting JSON data
#          resource describes the path to the sTeam object within sTeam
#          returns the data of the requested object
#      post(resource, data):
#          POST data to update existing sTeam objects
#          resource describes the path to the sTeam object to be updated
#          returns the data of the updated object
#      put(resource, data):
#          PUT data to create new objects
#          resource is the parent object within which the new object is to be created
#          returns the data of the updated object
#  (not sure in how much detail get, put and post descriptions should go. their
#  semantics are defined by the REST api so this should actually be part of the
#  REST api documentation)
