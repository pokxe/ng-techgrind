					h2 Does your startup have people working remotely?
					p As startups, often we work from home, work from a coffee shop, work from the customer location, or even work from different countries. Dont let that bother you! At TechGrind we have a perfect solution which many of us have used successfully for years: 
						b a permanent VoIP & chat server
						| .
					h2 What's a "
						i permanent VoIP & chat server
						| "???
					p
						| It is a tool like TeamSpeak, or Mumble, or any other VoIP software that lets you login to a voice-chat server and stay connected as long as you want. Not to be confused with things like Skype - which are temporary, and not permanently server-hosted (poor quality).
						| On TeamSpeak you can create chat rooms, have conference calls, and stay connected to your team, customers, investors, and basically anybody no matter where you are in the world - all the time - 24/7. There is even a mobile client you can take with you on the go.
						| It is the best quality VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) solution out there. No more creaky Skype calls with poor voice quality and disconnects. Use a fully server-hosted VoIP service and your needs are answered!
					h2 Great! How do I join?
					p
						ul
							li First go download TeamSpeak here: <a href="http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads" target="_blank">www.teamspeak.com</a> and then install. Yes! Its FREE!

							li iPhone Version here: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/teamspeak-3/id577628510?mt=8" target="_blank">Apple iTunes Store</a>
							li Once you've done that, simply connect to our TS3 server @ 
								b talk.techgrind.asia 
								| (NO password needed!)
							li Viola! Thats it! You will probably need to configure your sound settings. Otherwise, youre ready to chat!
						| If you want to have your own private channels and sub-channels setup, just contact one of the admins!
