	content_docbrowser:
		display-style___________
		this content display plugin should display a file-browser-like window.
			it should have a breadcrumb navigation added to it so that users can
			smartly navigate up and down a category tree.
			both individual files/objects can be viewed in one container as well as
			categories (eg: folders).
			these should be all displayed as small thumbnails with the following info:
		* <thumbnail:filetype> (eg: folder, PDF, word-doc, image, source-code, office-document)
		* name
		* author [does not show on "folders/categories"]
		* rank (1 to 5 stars) [does not show on "folders/categories"]
		
		example folder:
		* <image:folder>
		* Legal Templates

		example doc:
		* <image:PDF>
		* NDA - Harvard-Business-School
		* HBS Administration Team
		* 5
		
		example office-document:
		* <image:calc-sheet>
		* Founder Equity Calculator
		* Efraim Pettersson
		* 4
		
		functional goal___________
		this plugin should display objects in a filebrowser-like-fashion.
			user interacts with plugin im similar fashion as a file-browser.
			clicking on a folder, takes user to another sub-category.
			breadcrumb navigation is maintained in the navigation bar at top of plugin.
			when user clicks on file/doc/object, user should have the option to download, or open.
			the "open" button should be grayed out, if it is an object-type we do not have an application
			on the website to open the object with. eg: .psd file (needs photoshop, and we dont have it on
			the website).
			
		example-object -> displayed information ==> action-on-interaction:
			doc/template/file -> object thumbnail + name ==> full-content-view // download to user
